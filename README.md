# DynamicProcessor
Dynamic range processing audio plugin

This will be consisted of three main stages: A compressor, a noise gate and a transient shaper. The main idea 
is that the user will be able to use each processing unit in different stages inside the internal signal chain to experiment with
how each one effects the dynamics of a signal.

November 2017:
The UI for each stage are done, but not audio functionality yet

To be added:
-UI component to set the state (on/off) and position of each module.
-Code the audio algorithm of each effect
